Programs for Comp. Sci. class.

These are some of the programs that Nicholas Vaughan wrote for his computer
science class in 2016 Spring at the University of St. Thomas Aquinas, Houston,
TX.

These have been modified by Thomas Vaughan in order to make suggestions about
C++ style, about how to use GNU make, etc.
